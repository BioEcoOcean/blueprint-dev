  <h1>Introduction to the Blueprint</h1>
  <p><em>Note: this tool is currently in early development. Questions included are not final as this is still an early draft.</em></p><br>
  <p>The Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science (BIOS), or simply the <b>Blueprint</b>, is being co-designed as a support tool to promote a more integrated, policy-relevant, and inclusive biological and ecosystem ocean observing system. It is not meant to be a prescriptive manual, but a <b>question-based framework</b> designed to help and encourage users to think holistically and work collaboratively. It supports all stages of ocean observing: from reviewing existing knowledge and planning monitoring efforts, through data collection and management, to analysis, product development, societal application, communication, and evaluation. The Blueprint is intended to foster cross-sector collaboration and serve as a flexible tool for diverse users - from scientists and data managers to policymakers, civil society actors, and marine practitioners. The development of the Blueprint has been shaped through a co-creative process, involving interdisciplinary input from surveys, interviews, workshops, and feedback loops.</p>
  <br>
  <p> We believe that each component in the ocean observing value chain is interlinked and important. Explore the <b>interactive Blueprint</b> below to gain insights into how these components work together. The questions associated with each component are meant to be thought-provoking and encourage re-evaluation of the current system.</p>
